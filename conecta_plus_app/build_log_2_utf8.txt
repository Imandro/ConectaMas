- audioplayers_android compiles against 
Android SDK 35
- path_provider_android compiles against 
Android SDK 36
- shared_preferences_android compiles 
against Android SDK 36
- sqflite_android compiles against Android 
SDK 36
- url_launcher_android compiles against 
Android SDK 36
Fix this issue by compiling against the 
highest Android SDK version (they are 
backward compatible).
Add the following to C:\Users\Zbook\Desktop\C
onectaAPP\conecta_plus_app\android\app\build.
gradle:

    android {
        compileSdk = 36
        ...
    }

       1.  Dependency 
'androidx.browser:browser:1.9.0' requires 
libraries and applications that
           depend on it to compile against 
version 36 or later of the
           Android APIs.

           :app is currently compiled 
against android-34.

           Also, the maximum recommended 
compile SDK version for Android Gradle
           plugin 8.6.0 is 35.

           Recommended action: Update this 
project's version of the Android Gradle
           plugin to one that supports 36, 
then update this project to use
           compileSdk of at least 36.

           Note that updating a library or 
application's compileSdk (which
           allows newer APIs to be used) can 
be done separately from updating
           targetSdk (which opts the app in 
to new runtime behavior) and
           minSdk (which determines which 
devices the app can be installed
           on).
